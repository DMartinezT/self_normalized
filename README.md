# Vector-valued self-normalized concentration inequalities beyond sub-Gaussianity

Implementation of the experiments shown in the paper "Vector-valued self-normalized concentration inequalities beyond sub-Gaussianity". 

## Structure

The repository contains three Python scripts, which contain the working code of the experiments:


**main.py** runs the main simulations of the project. 
**ebub.py** contains the implementation of the empirical Bernstein inequality for the variance.
**utils.py** contains noise sampler and univariate empirical Bernstein.
